The ATM Machine

Implement a cash machine using Object Oriented Design. The implementation should be based on the idea that a person inserts their card into the ATM, feed their PIN and follow the menu instructions to handle the following cases:

  display current balance
  withdraw money
  charge the card with the money inserted into the ATM

When they enter an invalid PIN, display an error message about this fact and disable their card so that it cannot be used until it is enabled by the bank.
Display an error when a person tries to withdraw more money than they have in their bank account.
Handle the case in which the person tries to withdraw more money than there is available in the ATM.
Add a feature that saves all ATM operations into a log file.
An ATM operator puts money into the ATM.
